# Cassandra Notes

- Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across many commodity servers, while providing highly available service with no single point of failure.
- Aims to run on top of an infrastructure of hundreds of nodes (possibly spread out across different data centers). At this scale, small and large components fail continously.
